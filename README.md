## Introduction

The **telegram_cratbot_follower_campaign** project is a boilerplate chatbot for Telegram, built using the `node-telegram-bot-api` library. This README will guide you through creating a Telegram chatbot, and it assumes you have already generated an API token using BotFather on Telegram.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can start using this project, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
- A Telegram account and a bot API token obtained from BotFather.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telegram_cratbot_follower_campaign.git
cd telegram_cratbot_follower_campaign
```

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your Telegram bot API token as follows:

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_api_token_here
```

### Basic Chatbot Usage

The core functionality of this project is to create a Telegram chatbot with buttons that users can interact with. Here's an example of how to create a chatbot that displays a menu with buttons:

```javascript
const TelegramBot = require('node-telegram-bot-api');

// Create a new instance of the TelegramBot class with your API token
const bot = new TelegramBot(process.env.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, { polling: true });

// Event listener for incoming messages
bot.on('message', (msg) => {
    const chatId = msg.chat.id;

    const buttons = {
        reply_markup: {
            inline_keyboard: [
                [
                    { text: 'Facebook', callback_data: '1' },
                    { text: 'Instagram', callback_data: '2' }
                ],
                [
                    { text: 'Youtube', callback_data: '3' }
                ]
            ]
        }
    };

    bot.sendMessage(chatId, 'ü§ñ‚ò∫Ô∏è Welcome, in this chatbot you can acquire Likes according to your publication or video that you want to boost!', buttons);
});
```

This code sets up a basic chatbot that listens for incoming messages and responds with a menu containing buttons. Users can click these buttons to interact with the chatbot.

## Usage

To run your Telegram chatbot, execute the following command:

```bash
node your_bot_script.js
```

Replace `your_bot_script.js` with the name of your bot script file.
